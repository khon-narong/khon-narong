I’m a Java learner and aspiring **Spring Boot Developer**.

I’m focused on building strong backend foundations with Java and turning ideas into scalable, real-world applications using Spring Boot.

If a concept clicks, chances are I’ll experiment with it, break it, fix it, and ship something with it.

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA  
- **Databases:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- **Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Git, GitHub  
- **Learning:** REST APIs, backend architecture, clean code

### 🚀 What I’m working on
- Java fundamentals & OOP mastery  
- Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot  
- Database integration & CRUD applications  
- Exploring best practices and design patterns

### 📌 Projects
I’m building and pushing projects regularly as I learn — from small practice apps to full backend services.

### 🎯 Goals
- Become a confident **Java Spring Boot Developer**  
- Build production-ready backend systems  
- Contribute to open-source projects  

### ⚡ Fun Facts
- I enjoy solving logic problems  
- I like learning by building, not just watching tutorials  
- Always curious about how things work under the hood
